# Tora Installation

## Prerequisites

* Hardware Requirement:
  * 6th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) Processor or newer
  * Configure the system with the SGX hardware enabled option
* Operating System Requirement:
  * Ubuntu 16.04
* Software Requirement:
  * [Intel SGX Driver v1.9](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver/tree/sgx_driver_1.9)
  * [Intel SGX SDK v2.1](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/tree/sgx_2.1)
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)


## Installation

The following steps describe the installation for Tora **worker** and **master**. 

**Note:** You can install them on two devices or just on the same decice for test. But before the installation, make sure you have installed intel-sgx driver and  **/dev/isgx** should appear **on each device**.


<!-- Make sure again that you have installed intel-sgx driver, sdk and psw. To verify that you were successful, build the sample code in HW mode and run it.

```
  $ cd /PATH/TO/sgx-sdk-sourcecode/SampleCode/LocalAttestation
  $ make
  $ ./app
``` -->


###  Environment Initialization

Pull the Tora-Zilliqa source code, then switch to to the **env** folder, enter the following command:

```
  $ cd /Path/To/Tora-Zilliqa/env
  $ ./init_env.sh  
```
### Pull Docker Image

1. Pull the the two docker images on each device separately, and start a container for each image with sgx device support. 

  * 1.1 for the worker:

```
  $ docker pull teexio/tora_zilliqa_worker
  $ docker run --device /dev/isgx -it teexio/tora_zilliqa_worker /bin/bash
```

  * 1.2 for the master TEE node:

```
  $ docker pull teexio/tora_zilliqa_master
  $ docker run --device /dev/isgx -p 1234:1234 -it teexio/tora_zilliqa_master /bin/bash
```

2. Before launching the applicatoin, you need to do some initialization inside each container. 

```
  $ cd /root
  $ source init.sh
```

3. check if the sample code works in each container.

```
  $ cd /root/SampleCode/LocalAttestation
  $ make 
  $ ./app
```
